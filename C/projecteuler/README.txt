Each folder corresponds to a problem, and the number prefix is the ID. The idea
is to solve the problems in an imperative language like C, but also try to solve
them in a functional language like Scheme.

The problem itself, along with its solutions is written in an Emacs org-mode
file, and the sources are then exported. See https://orgmode.org/
