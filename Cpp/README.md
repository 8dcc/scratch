Scratch C++
-----------

Some C++ programs that I have written throughout these years.

The quality of this code depends on when it was created, so make sure you check
the file/commit dates, specially in the `archive` folder. I have chosen to keep
the old versions so I can see my progression.

Most of these folders contain their own README with more details.
